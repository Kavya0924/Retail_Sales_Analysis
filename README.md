## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 🟡 Python (pandas, numpy) | Data manipulation |
| 📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn | Static visualizations |
| 📊 Plotly | Interactive visualizations |
| ☁️ Google Colab | Cloud-based analysis |

---

## 🚀 Project Steps

1. **Upload dataset** to Colab
2. **Clean and preprocess** the data
3. **Explore** sales trends, top categories, and customer behavior
4. **Visualize** insights using bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps
5. **Summarize findings** for stakeholders
